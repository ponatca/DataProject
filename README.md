# Data Project

A python script is provided to generate a synthetic set for this exercise.

## Objectives

Build several web endpoints which exercise time series queries in two databases.

- [ ] Load the time series data into 2 databases
- [ ] Create a web endpoint to provide the count of available data from each database
- [ ] Create a web endpoint to compute the standard deviation of `value_alpha + value_beta * 10`, grouped by `time` daily and `class_gamma`, limited to a `start` and `end` timestamps provided as arguments
- [ ] Create a web endpoint that measures and returns the relative performance of the previous query on each database

Please use any 2 of the following open source databases:

- sqlite
- mysql
- postgres
